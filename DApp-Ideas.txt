1. EquityBanking

A money banking scheme, where a fixed number of participants commit to contributing to a deposit account periodically and each period one 
contributer gets a pre-agreed set sum of the period's total contribution. A form of savings with predetemined pay cycle.
Used in communities in  unbanked nations as a form of savings/banking to prepare oneself for a large upcming expensiture 
(e.g. Wedding, Birth, Trip etc)
Befor the contract is insantiated,
1. Participants set the rule for the payment schedule
2. Participants agree on the value of  ε
3.Can agree to set an inital "Buffer" deposit to mitigate possible future  non-payment
etc...

Example: Perons A,B,C,D,E,F,G and H commit to EACH contirbute (3 + ε) ETH to a deposit (contract) every 1st of the Month.
 (where ε is ETH used ofr maintenance, gas fees can be aribitrary). On Jan 1st, the deposit has 24 ETH + 8ε and Person A gets 
 the preagreed amount of 24ETH. On Feb 1st, person B gets 24 ETH and so on. By Sept 1st, the payment schedule cycles back to person A, whence the 
 participants can agree to terminate or continue the scheme forward for another cycle.

 
Implementation 
can be made to extend the basic concept to differnet rules such as
 - swap payment schedules between conseting participants 
 - increase/ decrease contribution amount mid-way in the cycle
 - make provisions to dissolve the scheme
 - other provisions to mitigate game-theoretical loopholes
 etc.
